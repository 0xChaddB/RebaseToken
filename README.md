# Croos-chain Rebase Token

1. A protocol that allow user to deposit into a vault and in return, receive rebase tokens that represent their underlyin balance
2. Rebase token -> balanceOf function is dynamic to show the changing balance in time.
    - Balance increases linearly with time
    - Mint tokens to our users every time they perform an action (minting, burning, transferring, or bridging)

3. Interest rate
    - Individually set an interest rate or each user based on some global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits into the vault
    - This global interest rate can only decrease to incetivise/reward early adopters.
